# MTG-Proxy-Generator
Forked from [philo-jh/MTG-Proxy-Generator](https://github.com/philo-jh/MTG-Proxy-Generator)
## Try the Live App Below:
[MTG Proxy-Generator](https://evinReynaud.github.io/MTG-Proxy-Generator/)
## What's different in this fork?
 - The cards inputted as code (with -cd) are not altered when retrieving data from scryfall
 - A dedicated button has been added to print the proxies
 - The requests to Scryfall's API are spread out to prevent a possible ban of users IP.
## How to Use:
Ever wondered how your deck would play if you just had those couple of cards? Now you can try them out before you buy with MTG Proxy-Generator! Create proxy versions of cards or even decks to playtest before purchasing. Just enter a list in MTGO format with one card name per line. You can then print them out 9 on a page and insert them over other cards in sleeves to playtest.
